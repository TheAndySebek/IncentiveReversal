# IncentiveReversal
A project that I made during my undergraduate career.
This presentation was intended to serve as hands-on practice with game theory literature.
I was asked to make a presentation in LaTeX, read Incentive Reversal (Winter 2009), and discuss what I learned from the paper in front of the Economics graduate reading group and the FSU Economics Faculty.
This was FAR beyond my skillset at the time. Although it is clunky and ugly, I learned a lot from the project. Thus, I shall share it to the world. Enjoy!
